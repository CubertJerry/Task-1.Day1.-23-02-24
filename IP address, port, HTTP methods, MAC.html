 IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address

IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):
An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main purposes: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the device in the network. IP addresses come in two versions: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers written in decimal format (e.g., 192.0.2.1), while IPv6 addresses are 128-bit hexadecimal numbers (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

Port:
In computer networking, a port is a communication endpoint that allows a computer to send and receive data over a network. Ports are identified by a number ranging from 0 to 65535. Ports are commonly associated with specific protocols or services; for example, port 80 is often used for HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) traffic, while port 443 is used for HTTPS (HTTP Secure) traffic.

HTTP Methods (HTTP Verbs):
HTTP methods, also known as HTTP verbs, are used to indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource identified by a given URL. The primary HTTP methods include:

GET: Requests data from a specified resource.
POST: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.
PUT: Updates a specified resource with the provided data.
DELETE: Deletes a specified resource.
PATCH: Applies partial modifications to a resource.
HEAD: Requests the headers of a specified resource without transferring the actual data.
These methods define the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations commonly used in web applications.

MAC Address (Media Access Control Address):
A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communications at the data link layer of a network segment. MAC addresses are assigned by manufacturers and are typically stored in hardware, making them permanent and globally unique. They are used for communication within the local network and are not routable over the internet. MAC addresses are usually displayed as six pairs of hexadecimal digits separated by colons or hyphens (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).
